Orders
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This test set uses black box testing techniques based upon a set of instructions to check if the unknown implemented code is functioning properly
When at a particular threshold the program should account for free shipping as well as taxes depending on the state. The taxed states include IL CA NY
Nextday shipping should include +$25 to the order price and Standard should include +$10 to the total price. Depending if the order price is above $50 will determine the cost of shipping
